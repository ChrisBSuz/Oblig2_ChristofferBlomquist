# Oblig2_ChristofferBlomquist

# Started by pressing "Share project on GitHub"
# Proceeded through the steps and calling the repository Oblig2_ChristofferBlomquist
# Had a few issues with 'build', it seemed i had created 2 branches - 'main' and 'master'. 
# So had to go back and forth through IntelliJ and GitHub to understand why and how, but managed to figure it out and merge them under 'master'.
# I forgot i had to 'Commit' each change i did, so when i changed the JDK from 17 to 21, i had a few errors come up in GitHub.
# After a quick help searches on Google i had the solution, an easy fix to be fair. 
# When i pressed 'Commit' and 'Push' on the top right hand corner of IntelliJ, i made sure to double check if the changes were uploaded.
# Throughout the rest, i just had to create a README-file in GitHub and here we are:)
